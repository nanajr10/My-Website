        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a wide range of interests and hobbies that I enjoy in my free time, but there are two activities that stand out as my absolute favorites. First and foremost, I have a deep passion for playing soccer. This love for the game has been with me since I was a child, and it has only grown stronger over the years. Whether it's a casual pickup game with friends or a more competitive match, soccer has always been a source of joy and fulfillment for me.</p>
        <p>In addition to soccer, I also find immense pleasure in spending time outdoors. I particularly enjoy taking leisurely walks along the beach, where the sound of the waves and the feel of the sand beneath my feet provide a soothing escape from daily life. Similarly, going on hikes allows me to connect with nature and enjoy the beauty of different landscapes, all while getting some exercise and fresh air.</p>
